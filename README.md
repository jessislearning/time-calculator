# 🕑 Time Calculator 🕟

The time calculator takes a <strong>*start time*</strong> and a <strong>*duration*</strong>. <br>
The <strong>*duration*</strong> is added to the <strong>*start time*</strong>, and outputs a <strong>*new time*</strong> and number of days.<br>
If the user indicates the start day (e.g. Monday), then Time Calculator will also output the name of final day<br>
<br>
💪🏼For this project, <strong>no Python libraries are used</strong>.<br>
<br>
The program accepts time in the following format: "hh:mm AM", where the minutes are integers less than 60.<br>
For the start time, the hours are integers between 1-12. For the duration, the hours are integers with no maximum limit. <br><br>
