# Time Calculator

The time calculator takes a *start time* and a *duration*. It adds the duration to the start time, and outputs a *new time* which includes how many days are added.<br><br>
For this project, <strong>no Python libraries are used</strong>. The program accepts time in the following format: "hh:mm AM", where the minutes are integers less than 60. For the start time, the hours are integers between 1-12. For the duration, the hours are integers with no maximum limit. <br><br>
